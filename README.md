# Knife-Score-Distribution-Initial-Investigation
Created a quick python program to analyze machine performance to better understand how our distribution and shape may be effecting our 3 sigma calculations for pass/fail of our FAT process.

Knife Distribution Analysis.py - A simple visualization tool to understand the skew and kurtosis of our data and how well it fits the imperical rule of normality by manually calculating the integral under the line of best fit to the binned data. The better the data has even spacing between the .15%, 2.5%, 16%, 84%, 97.5%, and 99.85% calculations is a good indication of its normality.
